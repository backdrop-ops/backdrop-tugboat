  php:

    # Use PHP 7.2 with Apache
    image: tugboatqa/php:7.2-apache

    # Set this as the default service. This does a few things
    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
    #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
    #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
    default: true

    # Wait until the mysql service is done building
    depends: mysql

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:

      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:

        # Install prerequisite packages
        - apt-get update
        - apt-get install -y mysql-client

        # Link the document root to the expected path. Tugboat uses /docroot
        # by default. So, if Drupal is located at any other path in your git
        # repository, change that here. This example links /web to the docroot
        - ln -snf . "${DOCROOT}"

      # Commands that import files, databases,  or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:

        # Use the tugboat-specific Drupal settings
        - cp "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/.tugboat/settings.local.php" "${DOCROOT}/settings.local.php"

        # Generate a unique hash_salt to secure the site
        - echo "\$settings['hash_salt'] = '$(openssl rand -hex 32)';" >> "${DOCROOT}/settings.local.php"

        # Copy the files directory from an external server. The public
        # SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be
        # copied to the external server in order to use rsync over SSH.
        #- rsync -av --delete user@example.com:/path/to/files/ "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files/"
        #- chgrp -R www-data "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files"
        #- find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
        #- find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;

        # Alternatively, another common practice is to use the
        # stage_file_proxy Drupal module. This module lets Drupal serve
        # files from another publicly-accessible Drupal site instead of
        # syncing the entire files directory into the Tugboat Preview.
        # This results in smaller previews and reduces the build time.
        #- drush -r "${DOCROOT}" pm-download stage_file_proxy
        #- drush -r "${DOCROOT}" pm-enable --yes stage_file_proxy
        #- drush -r "${DOCROOT}" variable-set stage_file_proxy_origin "http://www.example.com"

      # Commands that build the site. This is where you would add things
      # like feature reverts or any other drush commands required to
      # set up or configure the site. When a preview is built from a
      # base preview, the build workflow starts here, skipping the init
      # and update steps, because the results of those are inherited
      # from the base preview.
      build:
        #- drush -r "${DOCROOT}" cache-rebuild
        #- drush -r "${DOCROOT}" updb -y
